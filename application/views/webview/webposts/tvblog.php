            <h3>Resolution?</h3>
            <p class="longcopy">
                The best resolution is without a doubt 4K resolution or Ultra HD.

            <h3> Frameless vs Framed</h3>
            <p class="longcopy">
                A frameless TV screen becomes one with your living room decor, at times only visible when turned on. The framed TV screen stands out a bit, it is visible at all times whether turned on or off.

            <h3> OLED vs QLED</h3>
            <p class="longcopy">
                Both have vivid colors but OLED has unbelievable contrast.
                <br><br>
